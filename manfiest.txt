Project Name: Fraud Detection using PyOD AutoEncoder
Author: Shashwat Baral (Update with your name)
Course: MSCS 633 – Advanced Artificial Intelligence
Tooling:
- Python 3.10+
- PyOD (Python Outlier Detection)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)
Dataset:
- Kaggle: Credit Card Fraud Detection (https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
Description:
This project implements an unsupervised anomaly detection system for credit card fraud.
It utilizes the AutoEncoder model from the PyOD library, trained only on normal transactions
to learn the typical data distribution. Fraudulent transactions are detected based on
a high reconstruction loss (anomaly score) when the model attempts to reconstruct them.
The output includes the confusion matrix and classification report on the full dataset.
